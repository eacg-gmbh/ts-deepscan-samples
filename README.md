# TrustSource DeepScan Samples
[DeepScan](https://deepscan.trustsource.io) is a file and repo-scanning service, that allows to identify and isolate license, copyright and author information, which is hidden in repositories or source files. The service has been design as part of the TrustSource Open Source Compliance platform but will be released as a separate service during June 2020. We continuously try to improve the assessment quality of DeepScan. 

This is why we open up the repo providing test cases. Please feel free to add your specific cases and explain the issue they are addressing. In case of questions feel free to contact our support team at support(@)trustsource.io 

This repository contains a set of sample files taken from one of our solutions including the following cases:
i.	 simple author data
ii.  multiple authors
iii. author + date
iv.  incl. copyright symbol
v. 	 incl. multiple license information
vi.  incl. just (c) symbol, multiple authors
vii. multiple authors w/o author tag
viii.invalid license key, but longname
